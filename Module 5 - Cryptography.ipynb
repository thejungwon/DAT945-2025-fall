    "# Homomorphic Encryption\n",
    "Cryptography can keep secrets safe while sharing important information. Imagine you want to send a picture of a new traffic sign to your computer friend who can recognize traffic signs. You can put the picture inside a special envelope only your friend can open. It is like putting a secret code lock on the envelope. This way, even if someone tries to peek at the picture while it travels through the internet, they will not understand it because it is all coded up.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, let us talk about Homomorphic Encryption (HE) like in the figure. Your friend may want to learn something new from all the pictures it receives but still wants to keep everything secret. HE is like teaching the computer to do calculations on the coded-up pictures without actually decoding them.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is the practice of creating secure communications by transforming plaintext into ciphertext using mathematical techniques. These techniques are used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Basics of Encryption and Decryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption is the process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext. This is achieved using a secret key or a public key. The two main types of encryption are symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Symmetric Cryptography\n",
    "Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where a single secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of messages. This key must be shared between the sender and the recipient to enable secure communication. The encryption process can be represented by the mathematical expression $c = E_k(p)$, where $k$ represents the secret key and $p$ is the plaintext message to be encrypted. The encryption function $E_k$ is typically a permutation or substitution cipher, which operates on blocks of fixed length. The decryption function, on the other hand, is expressed as $p = D_k(c)$, where $k$ is the same secret key used for encryption and $c$ is the ciphertext obtained after encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Simple_symmetric_encryption.png\" alt=\"Symmetric Cryptography\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The security of symmetric encryption algorithms depends on \n",
    "- the key length\n",
    "- the quality of the key generation process\n",
    "- the mathematical operations used for encryption and decryption. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key length determines the number of possible keys that can be used for encryption and decryption, and a longer key length increases the security of the algorithm. The quality of the key generation process is crucial, as a weak key can be easily guessed or brute-forced, leading to a compromise of the encrypted message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the widely used symmetric encryption algorithms are \n",
    "- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)\n",
    "- Data Encryption Standard (DES)\n",
    "- Blowfish. \n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms use a series of mathematical operations to scramble the plaintext into an unreadable form, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to access the original message. \n",
    "\n",
    "**AES** is considered the most secure symmetric encryption algorithm and is widely used in various applications, including online banking and government communications. AES operates on fixed-length blocks of 128 bits and uses a key of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The AES encryption and decryption functions are based on substitution and permutation operations, as well as a key expansion algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DES**, on the other hand, has been deprecated due to its vulnerabilities and is no longer considered a secure option for encryption. DES uses a 56-bit key and operates on 64-bit blocks. The algorithm consists of 16 rounds of substitution and permutation operations, and it is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to its short key length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blowfish** is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that is known for its fast processing speed and strong security. Blowfish operates on 64-bit blocks and uses a key of variable length, up to a maximum of 448 bits. The algorithm consists of 16 rounds of substitution and permutation operations, and it is resistant to brute-force attacks due to its key length and the complex nature of the encryption and decryption functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Asymmetric Cryptography (Public-key cryptography)\n",
    "Asymmetric encryption is a type of encryption that uses two different keys for encryption and decryption. These keys are known as the public key and the private key. The public key is used for encryption and is openly shared, while the private key is kept secret and used for decryption. The encryption process can be represented by the mathematical expression $c = E_{pk}(p)$, where $pk$ is the public key and $p$ is the plaintext message to be encrypted. The decryption function, on the other hand, is expressed as $p = D_{sk}(c)$, where $sk$ is the private key used for decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://docs.huihoo.com/globus/gt4-tutorial/images/security_concepts_asymmetric.png\" alt=\"Symmetric Cryptography\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymmetric encryption algorithms are based on mathematical problems that are difficult to solve, making it nearly impossible for unauthorized parties to decrypt the message without access to the private key. Some widely-used asymmetric encryption algorithms include RSA, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. The RSA algorithm involves generating a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, and using them for encryption and decryption of messages. The encryption function involves modular exponentiation, while the decryption function involves modular inverse calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "DSA is another widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that is used for digital signatures. It is based on the discrete logarithm problem, which involves finding the logarithm of a given number in a finite field. DSA involves generating a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, and using them for digital signature verification and message authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a newer asymmetric encryption algorithm that is gaining popularity due to its strong security and relatively small key size. ECC is based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which is believed to be more secure than traditional discrete logarithm problems. ECC involves generating a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, and using them for encryption and decryption of messages. ECC is commonly used in applications such as mobile devices and internet of things (IoT) devices, where resource constraints require smaller key sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Key Exchange\n",
    "Key exchange is the process of securely exchanging keys between two parties. In symmetric encryption, a key exchange is necessary to establish a shared secret key. In asymmetric encryption, a key exchange is necessary to securely exchange public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used key exchange protocol is the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This protocol allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sender and receiver agree on a prime number $p$ and a generator $g$.\n",
    "The sender chooses a secret number $a$ and calculates $A = g^a \\mod p$.\n",
    "The receiver chooses a secret number $b$ and calculates $B = g^b \\mod p$.\n",
    "The sender sends $A$ to the receiver, and the receiver sends $B$ to the sender.\n",
    "The sender calculates the shared secret key as $K = B^a \\mod p$.\n",
    "The receiver calculates the shared secret key as $K = A^b \\mod p$.\n",
    "Both the sender and receiver now have the same shared secret key $K$, which can be used for symmetric encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is the process of converting data of arbitrary size into a fixed-size output. This output is known as a hash and is unique to the input data. The hash function can be defined as $h = H(p)$, where $p$ is the input data. Hashing is commonly used to verify the integrity of data, as any change in the input data will result in a different hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing algorithms include SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Digital Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital signatures are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents. A digital signature is created by taking a hash of the document and encrypting it with the sender's private key. The recipient can then verify the signature by decrypting it with the sender's public key and comparing the resulting hash with the hash of the original document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The digital signature scheme can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sender creates a hash of the document $h = H(d)$, where $d$ is the document.\n",
    "- The sender encrypts the hash with their private key, creating the digital signature $s = E_{sk}(h)$.\n",
    "- The sender sends the document and the digital signature to the recipient.\n",
    "- The recipient creates a hash of the document $h' = H(d)$.\n",
    "- The recipient decrypts the digital signature using the sender's public key, creating $h'' = D_{pk}(s)$.\n",
    "- The recipient compares $h'$ and $h''$. If they match, the signature is verified and the document is considered authentic.\n",
    "Digital signature algorithms include RSA, DSA, and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "Certificates are used to verify the identity of a person or organization in a digital communication. Certificates are issued by a trusted third party, known as a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA verifies the identity of the person or organization and issues a digital certificate. The digital certificate includes the identity of the person or organization, the public key of the person or organization, and the digital signature of the CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certificates are used to verify the identity of a server in Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) communications. When a client connects to a server using SSL or TLS, the server sends its digital certificate to the client. The client verifies the digital signature of the CA and ensures that the server's public key matches the one in the certificate. If the verification is successful, the client can trust the server and establish a secure communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Homomorphic Encryption:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Let's consider a homomorphic encryption scheme denoted by $E$ that encrypts a plaintext $x$ into ciphertext $E(x)$. The encryption scheme has the homomorphic property for a specific operation (e.g., addition or multiplication), denoted by $\\oplus$ for addition and $\\otimes$ for multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For addition:\n",
    "   $$E(x_1) \\oplus E(x_2) \\approx E(x_1 + x_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   For multiplication:\n",
    "   $$E(x_1) \\otimes E(x_2) \\approx E(x_1 \\cdot x_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   This means that performing the operation on the encrypted values is equivalent to performing the operation on the plaintext values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Arithmetic Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the context of homomorphic encryption, the basic arithmetic operations are usually addition and multiplication. The homomorphic property allows these operations to be performed directly on encrypted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For instance, consider two encrypted values $E(a)$ and $E(b)$, and let $E(x) = E(a) \\oplus E(b)$. If we decrypt $E(x)$, we obtain $x = a + b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Similarly, if $E(y) = E(a) \\otimes E(b)$, then decrypting $E(y)$ gives $y = a \\cdot b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The crucial aspect here is that these operations can be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it, preserving the security of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of homomorphic encryption, homomorphism refers to a property that allows certain operations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. There are different types of homomorphisms, and in the case of cryptographic applications, we are particularly interested in fully homomorphic encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple encryption function $ \\text{Enc} $ and a corresponding decryption function $ \\text{Dec} $. The homomorphic property can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**$$ \\text{Dec}(\\text{Enc}(a) \\circ \\text{Enc}(b)) = a \\circ b $$**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- $ a $ and $ b $ are plaintext values.\n",
    "- $ \\text{Enc} $ is the encryption function.\n",
    "- $ \\text{Dec} $ is the decryption function.\n",
    "- $ \\circ $ represents an arbitrary arithmetic operation (e.g., addition or multiplication) in the encrypted domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, applying an operation on the encrypted values is equivalent to applying the same operation on the corresponding plaintext values after decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break down the concept with an example using addition as the arithmetic operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**$$ \\text{Dec}(\\text{Enc}(a) \\oplus \\text{Enc}(b)) = a + b $$**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that adding the encrypted values of $ a $ and $ b $, and then decrypting the result, is the same as adding the plaintext values of $ a $ and $ b $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "**$$ \\text{Dec}(\\text{Enc}(a) \\otimes \\text{Enc}(b)) = a \\times b $$**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of cryptographic federated learning mentioned earlier, these homomorphic properties allow model updates to be performed on encrypted data without exposing the sensitive information during the computation process."

    "### Homomorphic Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. The result of these computations remains encrypted, and when decrypted, it matches the result of the same computations performed on the plaintext data. This property makes homomorphic encryption particularly useful for secure data processing and privacy-preserving computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Homomorphic Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Partially Homomorphic Encryption schemes support only one type of operation (either addition or multiplication) on ciphertexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addition (Additively Homomorphic)**: Schemes that support addition allow you to add two encrypted values together, resulting in an encrypted sum. When decrypted, the sum matches the result of adding the plaintexts.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Paillier encryption\n",
    "- **Multiplication (Multiplicatively Homomorphic)**: Schemes that support multiplication allow you to multiply two encrypted values, resulting in an encrypted product. When decrypted, the product matches the result of multiplying the plaintexts.\n",
    "  - **Example**: RSA encryption (when used without padding)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: In scenarios where only a specific operation (addition or multiplication) is required, such as tallying encrypted votes or aggregating encrypted sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption schemes support both addition and multiplication operations but with limitations on the number of times these operations can be performed. The main limitation is the depth of the arithmetic circuit, meaning the number of sequential multiplications and additions that can be applied to the encrypted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties**: \n",
    "  - Supports both addition and multiplication but only for a limited number of operations.\n",
    "  - The scheme becomes less practical as the number of operations increases due to noise accumulation, which can eventually corrupt the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Suitable for applications where a limited number of operations are needed, such as simple statistical analyses on encrypted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes support an arbitrary number of both addition and multiplication operations on ciphertexts. This makes FHE powerful but computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties**:\n",
    "  - Supports unlimited additions and multiplications.\n",
    "  - Can evaluate any computable function on encrypted data without decryption.\n",
    "  - Typically involves techniques to manage and reduce noise, such as bootstrapping, which periodically refreshes ciphertexts to maintain their integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Suitable for complex computations on encrypted data, such as performing machine learning on sensitive data, secure multi-party computation, and encrypted database queries.\n",

    "### Pyfhel Library\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pyfhel** is a Python library for performing homomorphic encryption. It stands for Python Homomorphic Encryption Library and provides an easy-to-use interface to the Microsoft SEAL (Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library) and other underlying libraries for homomorphic encryption. This library is designed to facilitate the development and testing of homomorphic encryption applications in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ease of Use**: Pyfhel provides a user-friendly interface to perform homomorphic encryption without needing to dive deep into the complexities of the underlying SEAL library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Support for Basic and Advanced Operations**: Pyfhel supports basic arithmetic operations on encrypted data, such as addition and multiplication, as well as more complex operations like rotations and rescaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexible Encryption Schemes**: The library allows users to choose from different homomorphic encryption schemes, including BFV (Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren), CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song), and BGV (Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compatibility with SEAL**: Pyfhel is built on top of the SEAL library, ensuring compatibility and leveraging SEAL's optimized and secure implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Pyfhel, you can use pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyfhel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use Pyfhel for basic operations on encrypted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from Pyfhel import Pyfhel, PyPtxt, PyCtxt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize Pyfhel object\n",
    "HE = Pyfhel()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate context for BFV scheme\n",
    "HE.contextGen(p=65537)   # Generates a context with a large prime modulus\n",
    "HE.keyGen()              # Generates a pair of public and private keys\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encrypt plaintext values\n",
    "ptxt1 = PyPtxt([5], HE)\n",
    "ptxt2 = PyPtxt([3], HE)\n",
    "ctxt1 = HE.encryptPtxt(ptxt1)  # Encrypt plaintext 1\n",
    "ctxt2 = HE.encryptPtxt(ptxt2)  # Encrypt plaintext 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform homomorphic operations\n",
    "ctxt_sum = HE.add(ctxt1, ctxt2)  # Encrypted addition\n",
    "ctxt_prod = HE.multiply(ctxt1, ctxt2)  # Encrypted multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decrypt the results\n",
    "result_sum = HE.decrypt(ctxt_sum)\n",
    "result_prod = HE.decrypt(ctxt_prod)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Sum: {result_sum}, Product: {result_prod}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Homomorphic Addition and Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at a more detailed example involving both homomorphic addition and multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from Pyfhel import Pyfhel, PyPtxt, PyCtxt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Initialize Pyfhel object\n",
    "HE = Pyfhel()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Generate context and keys\n",
    "HE.contextGen(scheme='bfv', n=2**14, t=65537)  # BFV scheme\n",
    "HE.keyGen()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Encrypt plaintext values\n",
    "plaintext1 = 10\n",
    "plaintext2 = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "ctxt1 = HE.encryptInt(plaintext1)\n",
    "ctxt2 = HE.encryptInt(plaintext2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Perform homomorphic operations\n",
    "ctxt_add = ctxt1 + ctxt2  # Homomorphic addition\n",
    "ctxt_mul = ctxt1 * ctxt2  # Homomorphic multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Decrypt the results\n",
    "decrypted_add = HE.decryptInt(ctxt_add)\n",
    "decrypted_mul = HE.decryptInt(ctxt_mul)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Homomorphic Addition Result: {decrypted_add}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Homomorphic Multiplication Result: {decrypted_mul}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The Pyfhel object is initialized to set up the encryption context.\n",
    "2. **Context and Key Generation**: The encryption context (scheme, parameters) and key pairs are generated.\n",
    "3. **Encryption**: Plaintext values are encrypted using the public key.\n",
    "4. **Homomorphic Operations**: Encrypted values are used to perform addition and multiplication.\n",
    "5. **Decryption**: The results of the homomorphic operations are decrypted back to plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Secure Data Aggregation**: Performing secure aggregation of encrypted data, such as sensor readings or private surveys.\n",
    "2. **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning**: Enabling machine learning models to train on encrypted data without accessing the raw data.\n",
    "3. **Confidential Computing**: Processing sensitive data in a secure and confidential manner, especially in cloud environments.\n"

    "### 3.2 Cryptographic Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "In network communication, a cryptographic protocol is a set of rules and procedures that govern secure information exchange. The primary purpose of cryptographic protocols is to ensure that data transmitted between two or more parties remain confidential, authentic, and integral. These protocols involve using cryptographic algorithms like encryption and digital signatures to protect the transmitted information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of cryptographic protocols include SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security) for securing web communications, SSH (Secure Shell) for remote login sessions, and IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) for securing network communications. Cryptographic protocols can establish secure communication channels between devices, authenticate users, and verify data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a cryptographic protocol can be defined as a tuple $(\\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{D})$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{P}$ is a set of procedures that define how the protocol operates.\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{A}$ is a set of algorithms used in the protocol, such as encryption, decryption, and digital signatures.\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{D}$ is a set of security properties that the protocol is designed to satisfy, such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption can be represented as a function $E_K(m)$, where $K$ is the encryption key and $m$ is the plaintext message. Decryption can be represented as a function $D_K(c)$, where $K$ is the decryption key and $c$ is the ciphertext. Digital signatures can be represented as a function $S_K(m)$, where $K$ is the signing key and $m$ is the message being signed, and verification can be represented as a function $V_K(m, \\sigma)$, where $K$ is the verification key, $m$ is the message being verified, and $\\sigma$ is the signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's digital age, where sensitive information is constantly transmitted over the internet and other networks, cryptographic protocols are critical in ensuring secure communication and data protection.\n",

    "#### 3.2.1 Private set intersection (PSI) \n",
    "Private set intersection (PSI) is a technique used to allow two or more parties to find the intersection of their respective sets, without revealing the contents of their individual sets to each other. Homomorphic encryption is a type of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data, without the need to decrypt it first. Combining PSI with homomorphic encryption provides a powerful technique for privacy-preserving set intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Private Set Intersection (PSI), a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties (a client and a server) to compute the intersection of their datasets without revealing any other information about their datasets. This has practical applications in various fields, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Password checkup:** Checking if a user's credentials have been leaked without exposing the actual password.\n",
    "- **DNA private matching:** Comparing DNA sequences to a database without revealing the sequences.\n",
    "- **Measuring ads efficiency:** Determining the effectiveness of ads without exposing client or user data.\n",
    "- **Disease Outbreak Tracking:** Health organizations can share data on disease outbreaks to identify common factors without revealing patient information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a PSI scenario, Party A has a set of elements ${a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}$, and Party B has a set of elements ${b_1, b_2, ..., b_m}$. The goal is to compute the intersection of these two sets, without revealing the contents of either set to the other party. To achieve this, homomorphic encryption can be used to perform the intersection operation on the encrypted sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the sets ${a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}$ and ${b_1, b_2, ..., b_m}$ are represented as binary vectors of length $N$, where $N$ is the maximum size of the sets. For each element in the set, the corresponding bit in the vector is set to 1 if the element is present in the set, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in PSI using homomorphic encryption is to encrypt the binary vectors of the sets using a homomorphic encryption scheme. Let's assume we are using a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme, which supports addition and multiplication operations on encrypted data. Let's also assume that the encryption function is denoted as $\\text{Enc}(\\cdot)$ and the decryption function is denoted as $\\text{Dec}(\\cdot)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Party A and Party B then exchange their encrypted sets with each other. Each party can then perform the intersection operation on the encrypted sets using homomorphic addition and multiplication operations. Specifically, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Party A encrypts its set ${a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}$ using homomorphic encryption:\n",
    "$\\text{Enc}(A) = {\\text{Enc}(a_1), \\text{Enc}(a_2), ..., \\text{Enc}(a_n)}$\n",
    "2. Party A sends the encrypted set $\\text{Enc}(A)$ to Party B.\n",
    "3. Party B encrypts its set ${b_1, b_2, ..., b_m}$ using homomorphic encryption:\n",
    "$\\text{Enc}(B) = {\\text{Enc}(b_1), \\text{Enc}(b_2), ..., \\text{Enc}(b_m)}$\n",
    "4. Party B sends the encrypted set $\\text{Enc}(B)$ to Party A.\n",
    "5. Party A and Party B then perform the following homomorphic operations:\n",
    "   1. They multiply the encrypted sets element-wise: $\\text{Enc}(C) = \\text{Enc}(A) * \\text{Enc}(B)$, where $*$ denotes element-wise multiplication.\n",
    "   2. They add up the elements of the resulting encrypted set: $\\text{Enc}(D) = \\sum \\text{Enc}(C)$, where $\\sum$ denotes element-wise addition.\n",
    "6. Party A decrypts the resulting encrypted set $\\text{Enc}(D)$ using the decryption function $\\text{Dec}(\\cdot)$:\n",
    "$D = {\\text{Dec}(\\text{Enc}(d_1)), \\text{Dec}(\\text{Enc}(d_2)), ..., \\text{Dec}(\\text{Enc}(d_N))}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting set $D$ is a binary vector of length $N$, where the $i$-th element is 1 if and only if the $i$-th element is present in both sets. In other words, $D$ represents the intersection of the sets ${a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}$ and ${b_1, b_2, ..., b_m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The privacy of the individual sets is preserved throughout the computation, as Party A and Party B never reveal their respective sets to each other. Furthermore, the homomorphic encryption ensures that the intermediate computations performed on the encrypted sets do not leak any information about the contents of the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this PSI protocol using homomorphic encryption assumes that the two parties are honest-but-curious, meaning that they follow the protocol but may try to learn additional information from the messages exchanged. If one or both parties are malicious, additional security measures such as secure multiparty computation may be necessary to ensure privacy.\n",
